## Project 01 Submission

Student: Guilherme Santos Brito,

The intent of the project is to build an Website for a Charity Project who cycles with the elderly in parks.
This is an existing charity, which I volunteer in the city of Malm√∂-Sweden. 
There are many more around the world, from which I took the reference images from.
